# Not Curry

This is an interesting problem is a variety of interesting solutions. It is
meant to encourage problem solving thinkings in a functional way in JavaScript.

The name _Not Curry_ comes from the lack of formal definition of what this
function is. It is curry like, but it's not really curry. It's sort of like
partial application, but not really. So for lack of a better name I think _not
curry_ embodies the essence of the problem. Think curry, but not really.
